interests: Hardware support includes GPU workstations from <a href="https://lambdalabs.com/">Lambda Labs</a>, Software Defined Radios (SDR) from <a href="https://www.ni.com/en-us/innovations/white-papers/11/what-is-ni-usrp-hardware-.html">National Instruments</a> in both sub-six and mm-wave bands, a variety of robots such as Jackal UGVs, Turtlebots and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/deepracer/">Amazon DeepRacers</a> and assorted Android-based smart devices. We are also supported in conducting real-world field experiments by the <a href="https://bcdc.tamus.edu/">Bush Combat Development Complex</a> located at a former Air Force base located about ten miles away from the main campus. Participants are encouraged to act as a community of experts and talk about their experiences with one another. Prototyping often poses many technical challenges. Getting involved at the LENS lab entails being exposed to the frustrations and the rewards associated with open-ended engineering problems.

<p style="font-size: 24px;"> The Learning and Emerging Networked Systems (LENS) Laboratory at 002 WEB is co-directed by <a href="https://cesg.tamu.edu/people-2/faculty/srinivas-shakkottai/">Prof. Srinivas Shakkottai</a> and <a href="http://people.tamu.edu/~dileep.kalathil/">Prof. Dileep Kalathil</a>. The objectives of the laboratory are to conduct analytical and experimental research in machine learning with networked systems applications, and to facilitate the integration of research into undergraduate and graduate education. The latter objective is directly aimed at enhancing the academic experience of engineering students at Texas A&M University. Key to the success of this program is the current enthusiasm among students for emerging technologies, including distributed learning and control platforms that operate over the network stack.</p>
